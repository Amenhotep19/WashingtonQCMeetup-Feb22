    "The quantum approximate optimization algorithm is a general method for tackling optimization problems using quantum computers. It closely resembles the [adiabatic quantum algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_quantum_computation). The first step is to encode the problem as finding the ground state of an appropriate _cost Hamiltonian_ $H_C$ that is diagonal in the computational basis. Starting from an easy-to-prepare ground state of an initial Hamiltonian $H_M$, the algorithm evolves the initial state under the time-dependent Hamiltonian\n",

    "H(t) = (1-t/T)H_M + (t/T)H_C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some choice of $T$. If $T$ is chosen to be large enough such that the Hamiltonian changes very slowly compared to the energy scale of the system, the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian will move adiabatically to the ground state of the time-evolved Hamiltonian, ending in the ground state of the cost Hamiltonian and therefore in a solution to the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum annealing is a version of this algorithm where the Hamiltonian changes rapidly in time, so there is no guarantee that the system will remain in a true ground state. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a take on this method where time evolution is approximated using a Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. Instead of evolving smoothly and slowly, the time of evolution is optimized at each step. \n",
